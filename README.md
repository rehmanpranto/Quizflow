## ⚙️ Get QuizFlow Up & Running!

Ready to start your QuizFlow adventure? Here’s how:

1.  **Clone the Mothership (This Repository):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/quizflow.git](https://github.com/your-username/quizflow.git) # Replace with your repo URL
    cd quizflow
    ```

2.  **Set Up Your Python Universe (Virtual Environment):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the Power-Ups (Dependencies):**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(This will install Flask, psycopg2-binary, python-dotenv, Flask-CORS, Flask-Mail, Werkzeug, and gunicorn).*

4.  **Awaken the Database (PostgreSQL Setup):**
    * Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
    * Create a new database (e.g., `quizflow_db`).
    * Connect to your database and execute the SQL commands provided (or use your migration scripts) to create the necessary tables: `users`, `quizzes`, `questions`, `quiz_submissions`, `submission_answers`.
    * **Crucial:** Populate your `quizzes` and `questions` tables with at least one quiz and its questions for the app to function correctly.

5.  **Configure Your Secrets (`.env` file):**
    * Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.
    * Add your database and email credentials. This file is loaded by `app.py` to configure the application. **Do NOT commit your `.env` file to version control!**
        ```env
        # --- Database Credentials ---
        DB_HOST=your_db_host (e.g., localhost or your Supabase host)
